Overview

Your task is to build a website using React based on the specifications outline below. This will be based on the Punk API which contains all
the data you will need for the task (there is also a link to a data file which we recommend you use before diving straight into using the
API). Please refer to Earworm as well as the sandbox apps we built together during the module!
You will have to use all of the skills you have gained over the course of the module to complete this challenge. Take things slowly and
follow Reacts recommendation for building an application as outlined at this link: https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html.

Data

Link to data on GitHub: https://gist.github.com/DanForder/63698b304305a96595dfb1b45f81e486

Requirements

1. Built entirely in React
2. Use the Punk API (after using the data file first) (https://punkapi.com/)
3. Test where possible (RTL)
4. Repository on GitHub

Plan

Start - All the wireframe content in black is the first part of the challenge - that is, the sidenav, the main section containing the beers and
beer cards for each piece of data. The component tree is below to help you get started.

Extension 1 - Once you've got the design and layout sorted to render the elements, it's time to add some search functionality. Make it so
you can search the beers by their name, and the page content should update as you type each letter in the box.

Extension 2 - Finally attempt to make it so you can filter the content on three conditions:
High Alcohol (ABV value greater than 6%)
Classic Range (Was first brewed before 2010)
High Acidity (pH lower than 4)

Extension 3 - Style the website however you see fit! Go wild!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
